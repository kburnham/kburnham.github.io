      <h1>Muslim views of USA/China</h1>

      <div id=intros>
      <p id='religionIntro'>In June of 2009 the United States' president, Barack Obama, made a speech in Cairo, Egypt in which he 
        sought 'a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world'. In the charts that follow we explore data from 
        a Pew Research survey taken in 2013 to see how Muslims around the world view the United States. For the purpose of comparison we also include data on Muslim views of China, the world's second largest economy, which, like the United States, seeks to cultivate relations with Muslims in many countries. <br>
        In our first series of charts we compare Muslim views with those of Christains and other religious groups. As can be seen, Muslims were more likely to see China favorably, and to consider China a partner and less likely to see it as a threat. This was opposite the pattern seen among Christians and other religions. On the other hand, respondents of all groups were more likely to favor the American economic model, and more likely to say that the US respected the rights of its own people. </p>
